NRG Automation Framework
================================

The NRG automation framework provides a means of storing, managing, and executing scripts within a programmatic
framework. Scripts can be associated with a site-wide level or scoped to a particular entity, identified by a
scope setting and loosely structured entity ID. Script runners can be defined and added dynamically to allow
flexible support for different scripting engines.

Building
--------

To build the NRG automation framework, invoke Maven with the desired lifecycle phase.
For example, the following command cleans previous builds, builds a new jar file, 
creates archives containing the source code and JavaDocs for the library, runs the 
library's unit tests, and installs the jar into the local repository:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Built-in support
--------

There is default support for the Groovy language. The Groovy version depends on the version of the
Groovy dependency specified either in this library's POM or in the parent POM.

Accessing the script service
--------

The default script runner service is available as a Spring service. You can include the script runner
service by using **@Autowired** to associate the instance of the runner service with a member variable:

```java
private final ScriptRunnerService _service;

@Autowired
public YourClass(final ScriptRunnerService service) {
    _service = service;
}
```

You can access the **ScriptService** and **ScriptTriggerService** instances in the same way:

```java
private final ScriptRunnerService  _scriptRunnerService;
private final ScriptService        _scriptService;
private final ScriptTriggerService _triggerService;

@Autowired
public YourClass(final ScriptRunnerService scriptRunnerService,
                 final ScriptService scriptService,
                 final ScriptTriggerService triggerService) {
    _scriptRunnerService = scriptRunnerService;
    _scriptService = scriptService;
    _triggerService = triggerService;
}
```

Storing a script
--------

You can store a script at the site-wide and project levels like this:

```java
_service.setScript("foo", "println 'Hello world!', Scope.Site, null);
_service.setScript("foo", "println 'Hello world!', Scope.Project, 1);
```

Running a script
--------

Running a script from the service is straightforward:

```java
final Script script = _service.getScript()
final Object output = _service.runSiteScript("foo", "one");
final Object output = _service.runScopedScript("foo", Scope.Project, "1", "one");
```

The type of the output object depend on what the script returns.
